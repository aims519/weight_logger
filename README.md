# weight_logger
A Simple app for logging weights at the gym.

Exercises are divided into four categories ("CHEST","BACK","ARMS","LEGS"). A new exercise can be added to any category using the + button in the action bar.

A long press on an exercise will allow you to update the current weight for the exercise or delete it.

A Settings screen allows exercises to be sorted either alphabetically or in the order they were entered. A warning message can also be displayed against an exercise if the weight has not been updated for a given number of days.

A full reset option is provided to wipe the database.
